The book series are a tutorial to create a ray tracer from scratch in C++. My
work implemented this tutorial and documented the progress with graphics of the
rendered images. There are three different materials implemented (diffuse, metal
and glass). Some mathematical formulas that interested me are also included. 
The source code lays in https://github.com/haaarp/rayTracingWeekend/ and has
additional features already implemented. In the repository is also report and
presentation.
